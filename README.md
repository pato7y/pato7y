Hi, I'm Serhat YÄ±ldÄ±z, a third-year irregular computer engineering student at Ã‡ankaya University. I'm eager to learn, explore, and develop my skills, and I share projects via GitHub. Additionally, I'm interested in discovering my strengths within various areas such as full-stack development (ASP.NET, Bootstrap, C#, JavaScript, CSS, HTML), cybersecurity, IoT, web and mobile app development (Flutter), and game development (Unity with C#). I'm open to learning and continuously improving myself. Furthermore, I would be grateful for any opportunities.
